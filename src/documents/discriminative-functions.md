# Discriminative functions

The functions {@link index!schemaDescribesSubset}, {@link
index!schemaDescribesEmptySet}, {@link index!schemasAreEquivalent} and {@link
index!schemaDescribesUniverse}, which return `boolean | null` values are
referred to as **_discriminative functions_**. (As opposed to {@link
index!toDNF}, which doesn't discriminate anything but rather transforms the
provided schema.)
