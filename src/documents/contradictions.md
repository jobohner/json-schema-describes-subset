# Contradictions

The reasons why a [discriminative function](./discriminative-functions.md) would
return `true` are also referred to as **_contradictions_**, since they are
determined in {@link index!schemaDescribesEmptySet} and a schema's internal
contradiction would be a reason why the schema doesn't accept any value and
therefore describes the empty set.
